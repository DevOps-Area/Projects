## Creating a single HAProxy and two Apache containers with Docker compose

- In this porject  we will create  two identical Apache servers and one HAProxy container. 

- When we want to access our website, we will be calling HAProxy, not the Apache servers. HAProxy will divert traffic to Apache servers in "round-robin" fashion.

1. HTTP Request goes to HAProxy container.

2. HAProxy container goes  either Apache container 1 or 2.

3. Response is served by Apache container 1 or 2.
